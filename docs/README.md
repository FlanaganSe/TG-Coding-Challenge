#### Planning and Requirements:

```
# General Notes:

- Use any framework (React - bootstrapped with Vite for ease of development)
- Responsive UI using a pre-processor (tailwind CSS)
- Focus on code re-usability and scalability

# Challenge / To-Do
- Create a page with a drop down list of locations. Display details of selected location (image, name, other data)
- Start express server by running `npm run serve`
- fetch location data at `localhost:3000/locations`

# Bonuses:
- Unit test
- Use state management (Perhaps Zustand, or simply UseState)
- Use ESLint for code quality
```

### Routes:

```http
# Locations

# /api/locations
GET http://localhost:3000/api/locations
```
